# Heart-Disease-Classification
The objective was to choose a classifier to check if a patient has a heart disease or not.
Data for patients was taken with an objective to build a classifier to predict if one has heart disease. 45.54% have it and 54.46% don't with males being the gender having more number of positive cases. 
Data visualization was used to check the relationship of columns with the target. Columns with a reasonable difference in mean of the target with respect to all columns were checked for Chi-Squared test.
The Chest Pain column had three types and was split to check their relationship individually with the target, the same was done with columns 'thal' and 'slope'. 
KNN and Random Forrest Classifiers gave the highest accuracy at 88.52
